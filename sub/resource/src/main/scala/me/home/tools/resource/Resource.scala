 *  - matcher: A function which identifies a dimension in the resource data block. It returns true only if the data block represents a valid instance of this dimension
 *  - usage: A function which generates a bitmap of the data block. For each element the bitmap indicates if this element is involved in the dimension. It is used
 *           to judge if two dimensions are orthogonal or not. It can be seen as some sort of 'stencil' on the data. Access to data clipped by this function will be
 *           prohibited.
 *  - project: The actual function of the dimension, projecting the data block onto the more abstract dimension. It allows to read the resource as this dimension.
 *  - inverse: The inversion of the project function. It allows to write the resource as this dimension. Orthogonal dimensions get invalidated by this operation.
